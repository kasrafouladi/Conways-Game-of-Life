\section{Introduction}

Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with algorithms for solving mathematical problems numerically. In this project, we explore various numerical methods, including Lagrange interpolation, Newton's forward and backward interpolation, and polynomial regression. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of problems.

The primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of these numerical methods in approximating functions based on given data points. We will analyze how well each method performs in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The results will be illustrated with graphs that depict the performance of each method against actual data.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 will detail the methods employed in this analysis, Section 3 will present the results obtained, Section 4 will discuss the implications of these results, and Section 5 will conclude with a summary and suggestions for future work.
